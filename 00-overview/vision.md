# Project Vision

## Introduction
This doc captures why we are building the product and what success looks like.
It keeps the team aligned when priorities compete.

## Problem
- Teams struggle to connect, monitor, and manage IoT devices at scale.
- Data arrives in many formats and is hard to trust or act on.
- Operations teams need faster insight and fewer manual steps.

## Solution
- A secure platform that ingests device data reliably.
- Real-time processing and alerts for operational visibility.
- APIs and dashboards that make data easy to use.

## Target Users
- Operations teams managing device fleets
- Product teams building IoT services
- Support teams troubleshooting field issues

## Success Criteria
- Time to onboard a new device fleet is reduced.
- Data quality issues are detected early and consistently.
- Critical alerts are delivered within agreed SLAs.

## Non-goals
- Building custom hardware
- Replacing all existing device firmware tooling

## Vision guardrails
- Security and reliability are never optional.
- Data should be usable within minutes, not hours.
- Every feature must improve operator experience.
