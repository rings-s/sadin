# Responsibilities

## Introduction
This doc assigns ownership so nothing falls through the cracks.
Keep it short and review during retros.

## Core responsibilities
- Product: roadmap, priority, acceptance criteria
- Engineering: design, implementation, quality
- Data: schema, validation, analytics pipelines
- Operations: monitoring, incident response, runbooks
- Security: policies, audits, risk reviews

## Escalation
- If ownership is unclear, the team lead decides.
- Decisions are recorded in `08-decisions/decision-log.md`.
