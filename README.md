## Introduction
Welcome! This repo is the home for our project documentation and team guidance.
It is written to help you lead and execute work with clarity and consistency.

## What this repo is
- A single source of truth for product, architecture, data, and operations.
- A lightweight playbook for how we plan, build, and run the platform.
- A place to record decisions so we do not re-litigate the same topics.
- A map for on-boarding new team members quickly.

## Project snapshot
- Product: Python-based IoT platform for device communication, data ingestion, and real-time processing.
- Focus: secure, reliable, production-ready services that scale with device growth.

## How to use these docs
- Start in `00-overview/` to align on vision, objectives, and stakeholders.
- Capture requirements in `01-requirements/` before starting work.
- Keep architecture and data models current as we make changes.
- Update tasks and operations as part of normal team rituals.
