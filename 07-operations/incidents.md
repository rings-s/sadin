# Incidents

## Introduction
This doc explains how we respond to incidents.
The goal is fast recovery and clear communication.

## Severity levels

- Sev3: Minor impact or workaround available

## Response steps
1. Acknowledge and assign incident lead.
2. Communicate status and ETA.
3. Mitigate and monitor.
4. Write postmortem and action items.

## Communication
- Use a single status channel.
- Update stakeholders at agreed cadence.
