# Assumptions

## Introduction
This doc records assumptions so we can validate or revise them quickly.
If an assumption changes, update requirements and the decision log.

## Business assumptions
- Customers want real-time device visibility.
- Support teams need faster root-cause triage.

## Technical assumptions
- Devices can send data over standard protocols.
- Network connectivity may be intermittent.

## Operational assumptions
- On-call coverage exists during business hours.
- Incident response follows the runbook.

## If assumptions change
- Create a decision entry in `08-decisions/decision-log.md`.
- Update impacted requirements and architecture docs.
